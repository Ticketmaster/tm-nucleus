# TM Nucleus

![alt tag](nucleus.jpg)

## Getting Started
In your terminal, enter the following:

```bash
$ cd nucleus-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You can now view the app at http://localhost:3000

## Development Work
Open up another terminal and type:

```bash
$ gulp
```

This will automatically open up a new browser tab and point at the Express app. It will also monitor source files for any changes.

If a change is detected, it will recompile the CSS and automatically refresh the browser window with the new CSS.
