# TM Nucleus

![alt tag](nucleus.jpg)

## Getting Started
In your terminal, enter the following:

```bash
$ cd nucleus-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

We then need to compile our files, so in another terminal enter:

```bash
$ gulp
```

You can now view the app at http://localhost:3000

## Development Work
Same as above, except in the second terminal you will now enter:

```bash
$ gulp dev
```

This will automatically open up a new browser tab and point at the Express app. It will also monitor source files for any changes and compile them as needed. The browser will refresh automatically for changes.
